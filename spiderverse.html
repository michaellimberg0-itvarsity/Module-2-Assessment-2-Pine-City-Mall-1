                    <p>Struggling to find his place in the world while juggling school and family, Miles Morales, a smart teenager from Brooklyn, reluctantly enrols in an elite New York City boarding school. Wrestling with his new responsibilities, Miles discovers a whole new world hidden at an abandoned NYC subway tunnel, only to get bitten by a stealthy radioactive arachnid from another dimension. Now, gifted with unfathomable powers, much like the original Spider-Man (2002), Miles is shocked to discover that life has become even more complicated, unbeknownst to him that he is about to get caught in the middle of a dreadful inter-dimensional conflict. More and more, with the fate of the multiverse hanging by a thread, young and utterly inexperienced Miles has no other choice but to master his newfound abilities, even though he believes that not everyone is cut out to be a hero. But a hero isn't the one who always wins. It's the one who always tries. Can Miles take a leap of faith and become Spider-Man?</p>
